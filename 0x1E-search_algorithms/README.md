# 0x1E-search_algorithms

This project folder contains files containing functions that illustrate various search algorithms written in C

## Tasks

A brief overview of the files and what is contained in them:


### Task 0

- File: 0-linear.c
- Function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
- Prototype:

``````c
int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);

``````

### Task 1

- File: 1-binary.c
- Function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
- Prototype:

``````c
int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);

``````
